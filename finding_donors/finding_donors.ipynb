    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",

We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "- Real-world Application: It is used widely in Natural Language Processing and Text Classification.\n",

    "- Weakness: Feature scaling is important as the algorithm is very sensistive to it. Multiple hyper-parameters need to be tuned properly.\n",

    "- Weakness: A major limitation of Naive Bayes is the assumption of independent predictors which rarely holds true in real life. There is a high bias when there is a small amount of data. \n",

    "- Strengths: It builds new trees to correct erorrs of previous trees. It achieves accurate results and is a significant upgrade on RandomForest in many use cases.\n",
    "- Weakness: GBC is expensive - time-wise. This makes it difficult to scale well. It may also result in overfitting.\n",

    "GradientBoostClassfier(GBC) is a type of tree-model. \n",
    "A Tree model is, in layman’s terms, like the Twenty Questions guessing game. The guesser might have questions like “Is it bigger than a bread box?”, “Is it alive?”, etc. The size or lifeness of the thing being guessed at is a “feature”. By winnowing down what is likely or unlikely based on these questions, you end up with a likely (but possibly wrong) answer. Part of the strategy in 20 questions is to order the questions correctly: the first few questions should be broad, so as to eliminate large number of possibilities. The last few questions should be more specific to hone in on the “best” possible answer.\n",
    "Now, what happens when a Tree ML is trained on the data set, the algorithm tries to come up with a set of “questions” that are ‘optimal”. Unfortunately, there is no perfect solution. So, there are different strategies to try to build the Tree ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine  20 teams (trees). A boss at the top, then subordinates, then more  subordinates, and so on. Team members are explanatory variables. Assume,  Trees = 20 and Depth (number of members in each team) = 5. So each team  will have 5 members, and total members = 100. We give them a book to  read, and then they will have to answer 20 questions (Number of  observations in our data). Assume they have binary answers: Yes or No.  Now, we start the process. The aim of the process is to maximum correct  answers by building 20 teams having 5 members each. Any member can be a  part of more than 1 team, and any member can have more than 1 more than 1  role in same team. The member which have maximum roles is the most  important variable of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The  process starts with a random guess of answers. Then it calculates error  ( = Actual - Predicted Answer). Next step, it build a team of 5  members, which reduces the error by maximum. Again, it calculates the  error. The second team (tree) has to reduce it further. But next team  doesn't trust its previous partner fully, so it assume that answers are  correct with x probability (learning rate). This process go on till 20  teams are build. So in the process, we have to decide, how many teams to  build (trees), members in each team(depth) and learning team, so that  error in the end is minimum. This can only be done by trial and error  method.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "1. It can be seen that reducing the data to only 5 features reduces the accuracy and f-score which is expected as the model was performing well and not overfitting.\n",
    "2. This model with reduced set of features is computationally efficient, time and memory-wise. There is some trade-off of accuracy or significant reduction in time taken for computation and prediciton. This trade-off needs to be decided on a case-to-case basis since a model with reduced set of features may not be able to comprehensively capture the overall complexity of data resulting in failure to generalize properly and even underfitting.\n",
    "3. In this specific case, it may be recommended to use the entire feature-set since the overall time taken is small and the model is not overfitting. In case, the model was overfitting or the training time was an important consideration, the reduced feature-set may have een preferable."
